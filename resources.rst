.. note:: If the below resources can't address a problem or question, good places to seek additional help are `the FRC Discord <https://discord.gg/frc>`_ and `ChiefDelphi <https://chiefdelphi.com>`_.

Kotlin
------
- `Kotlin Reference <https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/>`_
- `Kotlin Koans <https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans/overview>`_: Some interactive Kotlin tutorials by JetBrains. They can get pretty advanced at times.

WPILib
------
- `WPILib Documentation <https://docs.wpilib.org>`_: Your new best friend.

Motor Control
-------------
- `CTRE Documentation <https://phoenix-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
- `CTRE Examples <https://github.com/CrossTheRoadElec/Phoenix-Examples-Languages>`_
- `REV Javadoc <https://www.revrobotics.com/content/sw/max/sw-docs/java/com/revrobotics/package-summary.html>`_ *(Full documentation coming soon)*
- `REV Examples <https://github.com/REVrobotics/SPARK-MAX-Examples>`_

Math
----
- `Spline Generation <http://run.usc.edu/cs480-s13/lec08-splines/08-splines.pdf>`_: This is mostly done by WPILib, but it's still cool to know how it works.
- `Controls Engineering in FRC <https://file.tavsys.net/control/controls-engineering-in-frc.pdf>`_: A really good book about control theory in an FRC context. Chapters 1, 2, and section 8.5 are most useful.
