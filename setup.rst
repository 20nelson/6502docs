Setting up the Environment
==========================
Environment setup can be one of the hardest parts of FRC programming. If one thing is misconfigured, it can lead to problems down the road. Most installation options can be changed later, but it can be hard to track down the problem. If you have any questions or don't know what option to select, ask someone that knows. 

Java Development Kit
--------------------
For FRC usage, Java 11 is required. If doing ``java --version`` in the terminal prints anything other than ``java 11.x.x``, you need to install Java 11.

IntelliJ IDEA
-------------
You can either use the school-provided JetBrains licence (recommended) or the free community version of IntelliJ. 
Don't use the version from DA Self-Service because it is outdated.

Self Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Download JetBrains toolbox from JAMF Self Service, and either install or update IntelliJ from there.

Manual Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Start by going to `JetBrains' website <https://www.jetbrains.com>`_ and creating an account. 
If you want the Ultimate Edition, sign up for an education licence now. Once you have signed up and optionally registered for an education licence, download JetBrains Toolbox.
The toolbox is preferred to downloading IntelliJ manually since it will handle updates for you. Now, install IntelliJ from the toolbox after signing in with your account.

Initial setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you launch IntelliJ, it will walk you through initial setup. You don't need to add any extensions, and you have no previous configuration to use unless you previously had an older version.

.. warning:: IntelliJ can be very battery-intensive for laptops, so make sure a charger is on-hand for prolonged usage. 

You are now ready to write code!

.. You are now ready to :ref:`create a project <creation>`.
